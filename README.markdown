Meetup Streaming API Examples
-----------------------------

Please enjoy these examples of our [RSVPs](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/stream/2/rsvps/) and [Photos](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/stream/2/photos/) Streams

Clone this repository and run the examples locally in a browser. Since this repo's gh-pages branch generally tracks its master branch, you can cheat and also see them here:

* [RSVPs Plotted on a `map`](https://mirkof.github.io/stream/map/)
* [RSVPing members on a `photowall`](https://mirkof.github.io/stream/photowall/)
* [RSVP ticker](https://mirkof.github.io/stream/rsvpTicker/)
* [Picture this](https://mirkof.github.io/stream/picturethis/) photos stream
